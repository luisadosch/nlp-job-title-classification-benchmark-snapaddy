    "* Senior and Management are comparatively stable, with F1 ≈ 0.66 for both. These categories seem to have clearer title cues in the dataset and therefore contribute strongly to the overall weighted score.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Director reaches perfect recall (1.00) but low precision (0.36), meaning the model catches all true director roles but also incorrectly labels many non-director roles as director. This suggests the model overreacts to strong leadership keywords (e.g., “Head”, “Chief”, “Managing”) and tends to assign the top class too aggressively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the results suggest that prompt engineering improves consistency but does not fully solve the main challenge: separating neighboring levels and avoiding extreme-level overprediction (Junior/Director). Since seniority is ordinal, many errors are likely “one-step shifts” (e.g., Professional ↔ Senior or Lead ↔ Management), which still reduce accuracy/F1 even though the predictions may be close in rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Work: Improving seniority prediction further\n",
    "* We used a free trial account in Google AI Studio, which imposed token limits. This constrained how detailed the system prompt could be and, more importantly, how many iterations we could run to refine it. With a larger token budget, we would have tested and tuned multiple prompt variants more systematically.j\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, future work could focus on:\n",
    "A key idea we could not fully implement due to token constraints was adding consistency rules based on prior career history, for example:\n",
    "* Someone’s inferred seniority should not decrease as their career progresses. If a candidate has already held a senior role, later roles should not be classified as less senior unless there is explicit evidence.\n",
    "* Encoding this kind of rule would likely reduce unreasonable “seniority drops” and improve overall accuracy, but it requires additional iterative testing and prompt refinement to implement effectively."

The model was instructed to assign exactly one department label from our predefined label set based mainly on the job title (and any contextual cues available in the entry). We then merged the predictions with the ground-truth annotations and evaluated performance using accuracy, F1-scores, and a classification report to see how well the model performs across departments."

    "* The department prediction task reaches 79.61% accuracy, with a macro F1 of 0.73 and a weighted F1 of 0.80, clearly outperforming the baseline (60% accuracy). Compared to seniority, department labels are predicted more reliably, which suggests that the model can pick up stronger surface cues for departments.\n",

Sales (F1 0.87), Purchasing (0.83), Information Technology (0.82), Human Resources (0.80), and Customer Support (0.91) are classified well, likely because roles in these areas contain clear keywords (e.g., “Sales”, “Recruiter/HR”, “IT”, “Support”, “Buyer”).\n",

    "* The main weaknesses are concentrated in Business Development (F1 0.36) and Administrative (F1 0.55). These categories are harder to separate from more generic roles and are often semantically close to other departments (e.g., Business Development vs Sales vs Consulting). In addition, the dataset is imbalanced: “Other” dominates the test set and achieves a high F1 (0.86), which boosts the weighted F1. \n",

For example, we would add clearer decision rules and keyword heuristics to separate Business Development from Sales and Consulting, and to better distinguish Administrative from Other by emphasizing typical tasks (coordination, office management, clerical work) rather than broad role wording. With a larger iteration budget, we could systematically test prompt variants and use the per-class report to refine the prompt until the weakest categories improve."
